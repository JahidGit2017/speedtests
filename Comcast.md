## My recent experience with Comcast

- I used to be generally happy with Comcast service, except for the fact they have no real competition (on speeds) where I live.
- In the past, I used to see consistent speeds between Comcast speedtest sites and other independent speedtest site in the Bay Area. I was seeing ~90Mbps down and 5.5MBps up pretty consistently, regardless of which speed-test service I used.
- In Oct 2018, Comcast raised my bill from $64.95/month, to $81.95/month (a 26% hike). When I objected to the price hike, their rep told me I'm on a 'extreme' plan, giving me "up to 150Mbs" down. Since I've never seen this speed from Comcast, not even vs their own speed-test, I objected to the price hike saying all I ask of them is to leave the price and service as-is ($64.95/month for ~90Mbps down). Once I complained, they cancelled the price hike. Service remained good for a while.
- In Sep 2019, I got an email from Comcast saying (quote): ***"The download speed included with your current Xfinity Internet plan has been increased from 150/5 Mbps to 175/5 Mbps. We know how important your network is to you, and we want to thank you for choosing us to be your trusted Internet provider."***
- In reality, nothing changed...  I was still seeing the usual ~90Mbps down, so I was happy.
- A few weeks later, I noticed a significant service degradation. When I checked the Comcast site, I saw that something changed in the Comcast system. My plan became "Up to 75Mbps". Rather than staying at ~90 Mbps as it has been for years, The speeds I get went sharply down, and are now much less than the claimed "75Mbps".
- In essence Comcast is forcing me to pay them more by throttling my speeds down. If I want my old speed back, I will have to pony-up and explicitly ask Comcast for a higher speed.
- This is what prompted me to publish my story.

## Bottom line

_In reality, the speed claimed by Comcast is *not representative of real average speeds* I experience._

_The service levels are *significantly worse* when accessing most or even all parts of the internet (except Comcast dedicated and misleading speedtest sites)_

_Comcast is throttling speeds down in order to push customers to higher-priced plans_
